## What is MNkSupportUtilities?

MNkSupportUtilities contains different kinds of custom UI elements, subclasses, methods, and extensions to maintain a more organized, clear, and reusable codebase in your Swift project.

‚ö†Ô∏è From `v3.0.0` onward,  MNkAlertView, AppSymbol, UIKitChain and, the CustomLayout are moved to separate libraries and will not be a part of the MNkSupportUtilites.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you are willing to use MNkSupportUtilities with other separated libraries, you must use `v3.0.0` upwards. And the older versions below `v2.0.3` will not be support to use along with the separate libraries.

## Installation

### CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```ruby
$ gem install cocoapods
```
To integrate MNkSupportUtilities into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your Podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '12.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'MNkSupportUtilities', '~> 2.0.3'
end
```
Then, run the following command:
```ruby
$ pod install
```

### Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It‚Äôs integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

> Xcode 11+ is required to build MNkSupportUtilities using Swift Package Manager.

```Swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/MnkGitBox/MNkSupportUtilities.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "2.0.3"))
]
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate MNkSupportUtilities into your project manually.
